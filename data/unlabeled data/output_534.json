    "534": "Description: The Organization As an independent research organization, the Morgridge Institute for Research explores uncharted scientific territory to discover tomorrow’s cures. In affiliation with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we support researchers who take a fearless approach to advancing human health in emerging fields such as regenerative biology, metabolism, virology and medical engineering. Through public programming, we work to inspire scientific curiosity in everyday life. In the Cantor lab (https://morgridge.org/research/labs/cantor/), our guiding hypothesis is that existing model systems have masked critical insights into human cell-environment interactions. We test this through a variety of approaches at the interface of basic biology and engineering – integrating our efforts in tool development with methods in biochemistry, systems biology, functional genomics, and chemical genetics. Our broad goals are to better understand the role of environmental factors in basic human cell physiology and drug sensitivity – with a particular focus on blood cancers and normal immune cells. This position is immediately available for an enthusiastic individual with an interest in the areas described above. The successful candidate will have an opportunity to join our passionate team of trainees who are currently pursuing a diverse suite of multidisciplinary projects. The candidate is expected to play an integral role in establishing a new gene essentiality profiling platform that integrates CRISPR/Cas9-based screening with a novel bioreactor-based platform to identify genetic dependencies in cancer cells growing under controlled conditions that more closely simulate those in the body. In addition, the candidate will also work with Dr. Cantor to identify additional (project) opportunities that support their scientific and professional development. Our team is jointly affiliated with the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Morgridge Institute for Research, where our lab is located. We have additional affiliations with the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, and the Wisconsin Blood Cancer Research Institute. The selected candidate will be immersed in a rich scientific community and will build expertise in advanced in vitro modeling and an array of cutting-edge technologies (e.g., metabolomics, CRISPR screens, and bioreactor-based cell culture) while being part of a supportive and collaborative environment with state-of-the-art tools and access to a variety of core facilities. Requirements: Candidate Requirements Skills and Competencies Required: Experience with standard techniques in molecular biology (e.g., PCR, cloning, bacterial culture) Self-motivated, detail-oriented, and organized Strong communication skills Strong time management skills Strong problem-solving skills Ability and willingness to work independently, collaboratively, and in a team environment Willingness to learn and receive feedback Required Qualifications: Ph.D. or equivalent at the time of appointment or soon thereafter from a program in biochemistry, biotechnology, cancer/cell biology, bioengineering, or a related field Preferred Qualifications: Research experience in one or more of the following: mammalian cell culture, CRISPR-based genome editing, metabolite profiling, R, and NGS data analysis Track record of leading a project(s) to peer-reviewed publication during Ph.D. training Demonstrated ability to successfully work as part of a collaborative research effort Job Duties: Research (70%) – design and execution of experiments, data analysis Reporting (15%) – manuscript preparation, assist in the grant proposal preparation Collaboration (10%) – assist other lab members and research collaborators Laboratory protocol (5%) – routine/rotating lab jobs In order to insure the safety of our workplace, proof of COVID-19 vaccination is required unless an exemption is granted for medical, disability or religious reasons. The Morgridge Institute for Research promotes and supports an inclusive and diverse environment and offers competitive salary and benefits."
