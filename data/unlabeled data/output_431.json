    "431": "OXMAN OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design. At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it. We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments. This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature. Summary OXMAN is seeking a Lab Technician to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. This person takes pride in executing their work with the highest levels of accuracy and precision, demonstrating independence, uncompromising integrity, and a drive for perfection. The ideal candidate brings experience in conducting a variety of biological, chemical, and/or physical lab experiments, often managing multiple studies at once. Under the general supervision of the project lead, they will take ownership of setting up scientific experiments, running multiple tests according to defined protocols, cataloging specimens, and maintaining equipment. They will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of data-driven bioengineering and design projects involving plant life and associated ecologies. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research and experimental demonstrations rooted in sound scientific approaches and process-driven design with biology at its core; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility. This is a temporary role (3-6 months) with the potential for extension or full-time hire based on fit and performance. Core responsibilities Conduct various lab experiments by following and executing a wide range of pre-defined chemical and biological research protocols Ensure accuracy, precision, and safety compliance in all stages of the experiment, including set up, calibration, clean up, and resets Maintain high-quality documentation of experiments and generated results in the form of written reports, electronic lab notebooks, internal databases, etc. Suggest protocol improvements whenever possible Report unusual results, errors, or technology-related matters promptly and fully Maintain physical and digital databases of specimens Perform routine laboratory tasks such as preparing specimens and solutions; sterilizing, cleaning, maintaining, and troubleshooting equipment; maintaining well-organized work areas; and ordering supplies Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly, including by engaging in team meetings, presentations, and other creative communication outlets Qualifications & competencies BS degree in biology, chemistry, or a related field Prior experience in a professional lab environment is a plus Portfolio of successful scientific work demonstrating stellar taste and attention to detail Experience in running a variety of chemical and biological lab experiments Excellent manual dexterity and acuity to prepare specimens and operate instrumentation Ability to concentrate for long periods of time, apply good judgment, and meet deadlines Ability to thrive in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment Occasional travel to field sites and night/weekend/holiday coverage may be required Independent, self-motivated, detail-oriented, accurate, and highly organized Strong commitment to the team; maintains positive working relationships with diverse people, including internal team and external partners Embodies ethics and integrity in all work with impeccable scientific integrity, respecting both company and broader community policies in all conduct OXMAN does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristics.
