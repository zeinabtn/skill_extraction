    "590": "Why Stokes? Stokes Healthcare is a privately-owned business comprised of two divisions: Epicur Pharma (503B facility) and Stokes Pharmacy (503A pharmacy). The two divisions operate out of separate facilities in Mount Laurel, NJ, following different regulations and are guided by different principles. Stokes Pharmacy was founded in 1975. The pharmacy formulates custom prescription medicines for both humans and animals. The business has grown from a small, hometown operation in Medford, New Jersey, to a respected pharmacy serving the entire U.S., enabled by sophisticated online ordering and overnight shipping capabilities. Stokes Healthcare has built a reputation for unwavering quality and superb service by holding fast to the founders’ commitment to traditional craftsmanship, combined with today’s most advanced knowledge and technologies. In a field where many corporate-owned pharmacies try to compete on price, Stokes has always put safety and quality first. In 2016, Stokes Healthcare built a world-class facility (which became Epicur Pharma), as a testament to the commitment to providing the highest level of quality. Because patients’ lives depend on it. To produce the highest quality compounded drugs, the FDA highly recommended compounding pharmacies obtain registration by the FDA as an outsourcing facility. Only a handful of compounding pharmacies in the entire nation did so. Epicur Pharma has the expertise and dedication to meet these high standards for consistency and quality—one more reason that patients and doctors have trusted Stokes Healthcare for their medication needs for more than 40 years. Adding a unique new offering to the veterinary industry, Epicur Pharma is a mini-manufacturer, producing drugs such as Tacrolimus Eyedrops, Buprenorphine Injection and Gabapentin tablets. Epicur is overseen by the FDA and is considered a 503B Registered Outsourcing Facility. Epicur follows Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) which are the same rules and regulations as the pharmaceutical companies. Epicur Pharma is proud to be a pioneer in animal drug standards, offering the largest selection of manufactured drugs that are traditionally compounded. Epicur products will be distributed directly to veterinary hospitals from our outsourcing facility and offered through Stokes Pharmacy for individual patient prescriptions. At Stokes, we offer competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, dental and vision coverage, Health Reimbursement Account, Flexible Spending Account, 401(K) retirement savings plan with a generous employer match, paid holidays and vacation time, and an excellent working environment. We are conveniently located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, just minutes from Philadelphia and the New Jersey shore.
