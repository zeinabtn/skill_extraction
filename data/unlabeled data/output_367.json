In this role, your goal is to ensure that all our initiatives in Concept Art are owned, supported, managed, and executed by the right people at the right time.

We’re building a new IP, and its concept art initiatives must represent all the qualities of a Blizzard game. This role will be responsible for the delivery of all concept art in the game, making sure it is all delivered on time and on quality. Must Have: 8+ years proven experience in an Art Department. 4+ years of leadership experience. Demonstrated experience working with external partners. You are good at: Collaborating. With anyone and everyone, while always maintaining the visual aesthetic and spirit of the game. Leading, coaching, mentoring, and inspiring the creative team to do their best work in developing and creating a new world. Acting as a direct supervisor for the internal Concept Art team and all external Concept Artists. Managing briefs, dependencies and ensuring feedback is clear and actionable. Understanding the production of artwork from ideas through to final rendering Using excellent verbal and written communication skills to give clarity to everyone. Working with other leadership to define and help implement franchise and/or studio-wide initiatives. Partnering with other stakeholders, internal and external, to ensure consistency in quality. Working with production and studio leadership to manage project scope. You will push back when needed and suggest alternative ideas when appropriate. Anticipating future project challenges, spearheading solutions, and setting high-level goals for the team.
