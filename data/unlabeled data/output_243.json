    "243": "About our Company: Hotel Genevieve is a new hotel project from Austins acclaimed hospitality group Bunkhouse. At 122 rooms, it is Bunkhouses largest hotel to date and melds new architecture with rich touches that reference Louisvilles one-of-a-kind culture. Inspired by a city that is much more layered than bourbon and horses, the hotel is for a regional type of limestone, Saint Genevieve, which is a key ingredient in bourbon production. Limestone is also prevalent throughout Texas, providing a throughline from Bunkhouse origins to this new chapter in Kentucky. Saint Genevieve is also the patron saint of Paris, celebrating both the French origins of Louisville and the many women that worked to bring the hotel to life.
