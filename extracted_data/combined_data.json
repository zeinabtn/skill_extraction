The two divisions operate out of separate facilities in Mount Laurel, NJ, following different regulations and are guided by different principles. Stokes Pharmacy was founded in 1975. The pharmacy formulates custom prescription medicines for both humans and animals. The business has grown from a small, hometown operation in Medford, New Jersey, to a respected pharmacy serving the entire U.S., enabled by sophisticated online ordering and overnight shipping capabilities. Stokes Healthcare has built a reputation for unwavering quality and superb service by holding fast to the founders’ commitment to traditional craftsmanship, combined with today’s most advanced knowledge and technologies. In a field where many corporate-owned pharmacies try to compete on price, Stokes has always put safety and quality first. In 2016, Stokes Healthcare built a world-class facility (which became Epicur Pharma), as a testament to the commitment to providing the highest level of quality. Because patients’ lives depend on it. To produce the highest quality compounded drugs, the FDA highly recommended compounding pharmacies obtain registration by the FDA as an outsourcing facility. Only a handful of compounding pharmacies in the entire nation did so. Epicur Pharma has the expertise and dedication to meet these high standards for consistency and quality—one more reason that patients and doctors have trusted Stokes Healthcare for their medication needs for more than 40 years. Adding a unique new offering to the veterinary industry, Epicur Pharma is a mini-manufacturer, producing drugs such as Tacrolimus Eyedrops, Buprenorphine Injection and Gabapentin tablets. Epicur is overseen by the FDA and is considered a 503B Registered Outsourcing Facility. Epicur follows Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) which are the same rules and regulations as the pharmaceutical companies. Epicur Pharma is proud to be a pioneer in animal drug standards, offering the largest selection of manufactured drugs that are traditionally compounded. Epicur products will be distributed directly to veterinary hospitals from our outsourcing facility and offered through Stokes Pharmacy for individual patient prescriptions. At Stokes, we offer competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, dental and vision coverage, Health Reimbursement Account, Flexible Spending Account, 401(K) retirement savings plan with a generous employer match, paid holidays and vacation time, and an excellent working environment.

    "753": "Die Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft betreibt in Deutschland derzeit 76 Institute und Forschungseinrichtungen und ist die weltweit führende Organisation für anwendungsorientierte Forschung. Rund 30 000 Mitarbeitende erarbeiten das jährliche Forschungsvolumen von 2,9 Milliarden Euro. Das Fraunhofer-Institut für Elektronische Mikrosysteme und Festkörper-Technologien EMFT, mit derzeit fast 155 Mitarbeitenden an den Standorten München (Hauptsitz), Oberpfaffenhofen und Regensburg, steht für angewandte Forschung auf dem Gebiet »Sensor- und Aktorsysteme« für Mensch und Umwelt. Ihre Kompetenzen basieren auf fundiertem Know-how und langjähriger Erfahrung in den Bereichen Mikroelektronik und Mikrosystemtechnik sowie einem umfangreichen Technologiepark im Bereich Mikro- und Nanotechnologien, der Spitzenforschung sowie attraktive Entwicklungsangebote für Industriekunden möglich macht. In Forschungsprojekten ist die Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung von Materialien und Prozessen zunehmend von Interesse, denn die Produktion von Mikroelektronik ist nach wie vor mit einem hohen Energie- und Ressourceneinsatz verbunden. Zudem werden bei einigen Prozessen kritische oder umweltschädliche Materialien eingesetzt. Im Rahmen der vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung geförderten Green ICT Forschungsaktivitäten arbeitet das Fraunhofer EMFT an der Optimierung von Lithografie- und Ätzprozessen mit dem Ziel, Chemikalien- und Energieverbrauch zu reduzieren. Ebenso wird der Einsatz neuer Materialien erprobt, die kritische oder umweltschädliche Chemikalien ersetzen sollen, etwa bei Lösungmitteln oder Reinigungsgasen. Unseren studentischen Mitarbeitenden bieten wir Einblicke in unsere High-Tech-Forschung und bieten in unserer Abteilung \"Flexible Systeme\" eine Abschlussarbeit an. Was Du bei uns tust Du unterstützt uns bei der Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung von Materialien und Prozessen in einem laufenden Forschungsprojekt mittels Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) und erstellst dazu eine Abschlussarbeit. Diese soll sich mit der vergleichenden Bewertung von Beschichtungsprozessen für die strukturierte Metallisierung von flexiblen Trägermaterialien befassen. Literaturrecherchen sowie Einarbeitung in die Methode des LCA werden die Grundlagen für die Erarbeitung der vergleichenden Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung von drei Prozessvarianten darstellen. Was Du mitbringst Immatrikulation im Studiengang Ingenieurswissenschaft, Physik, Elektrotechnik, Informatik oder vergleichbarer Studienrichtung – oder ein Studienfach aus dem Bereich Nachhaltigkeit. Ein Interesse und grundlegendes Verständnis hinsichtlich Nachhaltigkeitsbewertungen wird vorausgesetzt. Du bringst die Bereitschaft mit, dich selbstständig in komplexe Nachhaltigkeitsanalysen (LCA) einzuarbeiten und wissenschaftlich zu dokumentieren. Darüber hinaus erwarten wir eine strukturierte Arbeitsweise und Spaß an der Arbeit im Team. Du bist mit den wissenschaftlichen Arbeitstechniken vertraut und verfügst über eine gute Kommunikationsfähigkeit in der deutschen und englischen Sprache in Wort und Schrift. Du hast die Motivation und Bereitschaft, dein Wissen an andere weiterzugeben – z.B. im Rahmen von Techniktagen für Schülerinnen und Schüler. Wünschenswert sind Kenntnisse hinsichtlich Beschichtungs-/ Lithographieprozessen. Was Du erwarten kannst Im Zusammenhang mit der Einbindung in ein umfangreiches Forschungsvorhaben im Rahmen der GreenICT Mission der Bundesregierung bieten wir die Einarbeitung in technologische Abläufe, Bereitstellen von Literatur und Trainings zu den geforderten Nachhaltigkeitsanalysen. Deinen wöchentlichen Arbeitsumfang sowie die Arbeitszeit kannst du nach Absprache flexibel gestalten und die Möglichkeit zum mobilen Arbeiten nutzen.
